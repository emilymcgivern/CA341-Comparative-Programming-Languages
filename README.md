# Comparative Programming Languages
This repo contains the assignments carried out as part of CA341 - Comparative Programming Languages

The specs for the assignments are as follows:

## 1. Comparing Imperative and Object-Oriented Programming

Implement the following program in an imperative style and an object-oriented style using any languages you choose provided they have an open-source implementation.

Implement a calendar program that stores the appointments for a one week period. The appointments can occur at anytime during the week, can be of any duration and there can be a variable number of appointments per day. The program should allow the user to add and remove appointments, as well as print the appointments for the whole week or any day within the week.

## 2. Comparing Object-Oriented Programming and Logic Programming

Implement the following program using an object-oriented programming langauge and a logic programming language. You can choose any languages capable of object-oriented programming or logic programming provided they have an open-source implementation.

Implement a program that provides the following operations on a binary tree.

insert adds an integer x into a binary tree T to give a binary tree R.
search returns true if x is contained in the binary tree T.
preorder lists the nodes of the binary tree T using preorder traversal.
inorder lists the nodes of the binary tree T using inorder traversal.
postorder lists the nodes of the binary tree T using postorder traversal.
